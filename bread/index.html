						<h2> Hello, and welcome to my website!</h2><br>
						<p>This is a subpage of my website, which I am using to handle bread orders. Below the story below is my ordering page,
                            which when I am selling will be open.

						<p>Here is my story about why I started to make bread. In the summer of 2024, I saw this video encouraging people to try this easy bread recipe.
							I figured I had nothing better to do, afterall, it was a hot July day. I woke up earlier than I usually did the next morning and got to work baking.
							A couple hours later I had a homebaked loaf of bread and an amazing smelling home. After that I took a couple month break from making bread, 
							as I became busy and forgot about it. But, around September, I remembered baking bread that summer, so I decided to try again. This time I tried
							cinnamon swirl bread. Once that loaf was baked, I knew I found a new hobby. Next time I made the bread I decided to change the recipe a bit, trying
							to make it a bit better, and now I like making wide variety of breads. Recently I've started making sourdough bread, a more difficult project than
							what I was used to. Although as of April of 2025 I haven't yet perfected my loaf yet, it is still a fun experience and getting to see each loaf improve.
                            I've also been making telera rolls, which is going to be the main type I am selling.
